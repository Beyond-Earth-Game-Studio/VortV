# VortV
VortV is an in-development game engine written in Python using [PySide6](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/quickstart.html)

## Installation
Executables are provided every tagged pre-release. Run at your own risk and be ready for bugs.  

Full installers will be provided when we have more of a finished product.

## Building from source
Packages are built with [pyside6-deploy](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/deployment/deployment-pyside6-deploy.html), with resources compiled using [pyside6-rcc](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/tools/pyside-rcc.html)
### Instructions (bash)
Clone this repo and create a virtual environment in the repo root (or not, your preference)
```
mkdir venv && python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate your venv
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install dependancies
```
pip install pyside6
```
Switch to the source directory
